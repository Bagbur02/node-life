# node-life - Get a life

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/antz29/node-life.png)](http://travis-ci.org/#!/antz29/node-life)

## Installation

    npm install life -g 

## What's it do?

An artificial life simulation written in node. Just starting this so not quite sure how it will all work yet! 
Basically thinking that 'life' is the 'world' and you create 'lifeforms' that communicate with the world through
a RESTful interface. By default it will be rendered to the terminal but in theory you could render it any way 
you liked.

## Usage

    Spin up the 'world'
    > life

## Bugs
